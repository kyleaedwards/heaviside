Heaviside
=========

A general-purpose pub/sub that works both inside the browser and across cross-domain iframes. The logic behind this is to reduce the number of separate modules that accomplish what is essentially the same task.

_Talk with who you need to, when you need to, with the same interface every time._

__Note:__ As Heaviside utilizes the window.postMessage API to communicate, it is currently only suited for modern browsers.
